Hi!
This is my project for the final evaluation of the REACT module at Adalab.
Here you can find the development of a web application where we can search for all the characters in Harry Potter. When we click on the selected character, we can see more details about them.
Languages I have used for the layout of this website.
HTML
Javascript
React

How can you start my project?
To start this project we need to run the command /npm start/
This command opens a window in our default browser and shows you my project.
Here you can search your favourite character and filter by house and gender.

Roc√≠o.
